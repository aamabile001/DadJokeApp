# DadJokeApp

[Download](https://github.com/aamabile001/DadJokeApp/blob/main/DadJokeApp.exe) my amazing dad joke app for Windows. It only works for Windows operating systems.

Check out the [code](https://github.com/aamabile001/DadJokeApp/blob/main/DadJokeApp.py) for the program.

It's my *second* GUI Python application. It uses the open and free API from https://icanhazdadjoke.com/.
